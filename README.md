# Unbounded-Knapsack

This is a simple javascript application for solving the unbounded knapsack problem.
The knapsack problem is as follows: Given a knapsack of a fixed capacity and a set of items each with a weight and value, determine how many of each item to place in the knapsack to maximize the total value of the knapsack's contents.

# Using the program

Enter a value for the knapsack's capacity. Then enter information about a particular item to be considered for the knapsack. As you add items by clicking the "Add Item" button, the table on the right will update as necessary always showing the correct combination of items to be placed in the knapsack to maximize the total value. You can also change the knapsack's capacity at any time by entering a new value in the "Knapsack Capacity" field and then clicking update. The table will update to reflect the changes.
